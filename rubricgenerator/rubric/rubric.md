|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**                | Function not implemented or incorrect | Basic implementation, but significant errors | Correct Fibonacci values, minor errors | Correct implementation, handles edge cases | Optimal iterative solution       |
| **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**                 | Function not implemented or incorrect | Poorly implemented recursion with errors | Correct Fibonacci values using recursion  | Efficient recursion, handles edge cases | Optimally implemented with memoization |
| **Execution Time Measurement**                                     | No timing function implemented   | Timing function poorly implemented | Correctly measures time but lacks clarity | Clear implementation and usage of the timing function | Comprehensive timing analysis and reporting         |
| **Testing and Validation of Functions**                            | No tests written                | Very few tests, missing edge cases | Some tests present, covers basic cases | Extensive testing, covers edge cases thoroughly | Comprehensive suite of tests, ensuring reliability |
| **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**                       | No documentation or annotations  | Minimal documentation, lacks clarity | Basic documentation and annotations present | Well-documented with clear explanations and type annotations | Exceptionally documented, follows best practices        |
