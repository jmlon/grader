# Evaluation of the Programming Assignment

## Learning Outcomes Evaluation

1. **Use of control structures**: **Score: 4/4**  
   **Verification**: The implementation correctly employs control structures in both the iterative and recursive functions. The use of conditionals to handle different cases (such as base cases and negative input) is well done. The score and feedback here are accurate.

2. **Use of function calls**: **Score: 4/4**  
   **Verification**: The program effectively utilizes function calls with appropriate parameters and return values. The separation of logic into different methods enhances clarity and maintainability. The score is accurate, and the feedback is sound.

3. **Handling of variables**: **Score: 4/4**  
   **Verification**: The program primarily uses local variables within functions, and there is a clear avoidance of unnecessary global variables. Each method manages its own data scope appropriately. The marks and feedback are thus correct.

4. **Program tests**: **Score: 4/4**  
   **Verification**: The use of `assert` statements thoroughly tests both the iterative and recursive functions against a suitable range of test cases. This ensures that the expected output is verified. The evaluation and feedback are accurate.

5. **Measuring execution time**: **Score: 4/4**  
   **Verification**: The implementation successfully measures the execution time for both Fibonacci functions. The results are clearly printed, providing a good insight into the performance differences between the two methods. The scoring and feedback for this task are appropriate.

6. **Following good programming practice**: **Score: 4/4**  
   **Verification**: The code is well documented, with clear docstrings for each method describing parameters and return values. Naming conventions are followed consistently, making the code easier to understand. The program also handles type checking and error raising effectively. The marks assigned and feedback provided are justified.

## Overall Feedback

This submission meets and exceeds the expectations set forth in the rubric. The program is structured, easy to read, and demonstrates proficiency in basic programming concepts such as control structures, recursion, and function handling. 

**Areas for Improvement:**
- While the handling of negative inputs is adequate, you may want to consider offering a more informative response, such as raising an exception, instead of simply returning 0. This could enhance the clarity of the function's behavior regarding input values.
- The program comments are well-written, but adding a brief summary at the beginning of the code could improve understanding for future readers regarding the overall purpose and structure of the program.
- It is good practice to include limits regarding the function calls (for example, what happens with inputs that are not acceptable such as large negative integers). 

Overall, excellent work! Your understanding of basic programming skills is clearly demonstrated throughout this assignment.
