### Evaluation of Submitted Solution

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   The iterative Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and handles edge cases effectively. The use of a loop is efficient, returning the correct Fibonacci values.  
   **Verification:** The score is accurate. The function appropriately handles edge cases and is optimally structured.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
   The recursive Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci numbers with the base cases accurately defined. However, it lacks optimization (such as memoization) for large input values, which can lead to excessive function calls and inefficient execution for larger Fibonacci indices. Implementing memoization would enhance the recursion's performance.  
   **Verification:** The score is justifiable. The function meets the basic requirements, but there's a failure to optimize, which is noted in the feedback. A score of 3 is warranted.

3. **Execution Time Measurement**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   The timing function is implemented clearly and used effectively within the main program for both Fibonacci functions. The structure is straightforward and clearly communicates the execution time being measured. More detailed reporting on execution time for different inputs could further enhance understanding.  
   **Verification:** The score is accurate. The execution time measurement is clear, but a score of 4 reflects there is still room for more comprehensive insights into timing analysis.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   The submitted solution includes a comprehensive suite of tests covering both iterative and recursive implementations. All test cases pass, demonstrating thorough validation. To exceed expectations further, additional edge and boundary cases could be tested, such as very large Fibonacci numbers for the recursive function (keeping in mind execution time).  
   **Verification:** The score is appropriate. The comprehensive testing reflects strong validation efforts; however, testing larger recursive inputs could further improve the score.

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**  
   **Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
   The code is exceptionally documented, with detailed docstrings explaining the purpose, arguments, returns, and exceptions for each function. Type annotations are present and enhance clarity. The formatting is consistent with best practices, providing clear guidance to any future users or maintainers.  
   **Verification:** This score is fully deserved. The documentation and type annotations exceed the basic expectations and follow best practices, justifying a perfect score.

### Summary of Improvements
While the foundational elements of this programming assignment have been met with strong execution, here are areas for possible growth:
- **Memoization**: For the recursive Fibonacci function, implementing memoization would significantly improve performance and efficiency. 
- **Expanded Testing**: Consider including tests for boundary cases and validating behaviors with larger input sizes to enhance resilience.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Although the iterative function handles negative inputs, it might be worthwhile to mention explicitly in the documentation that returning 0 for negative inputs is a design choice.

Overall, this assignment demonstrates a strong understanding of basic programming skills, control structures, and good programming practices. Excellent work!
