## Evaluation of Programming Assignment

Here's an evaluation of the submitted code based on the learning outcomes:

**1. Use of control structures (Score: 5/5)**

*   **Strengths:** The code demonstrates correct use of control structures, such as `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `for` loops, in both the iterative and recursive Fibonacci functions. The logic within these structures is sound and leads to the correct computation of Fibonacci numbers.
*   **Areas for improvement:** None.

**Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The student correctly utilizes control structures.

**2. Use of function calls (Score: 5/5)**

*   **Strengths:** The code effectively uses function calls, including passing parameters and returning values. The `measure_execution_time` function correctly calls the Fibonacci functions and captures their return values.
*   **Areas for improvement:** None.

**Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The student correctly uses function calls.

**3. Handling of variables (Score: 4/5)**

*   **Strengths:** The code uses local variables appropriately within functions. The iterative Fibonacci function effectively uses variables `a` and `b` to store intermediate values.
*   **Areas for improvement:** The use of a class might be overkill for this assignment. A simpler solution with just functions could be preferred. However, the use of a class does encapsulate the functions, so it is not necessarily wrong, just a matter of style. There are no global variables, which is good.

**Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The comment about the class usage is a valid point of style, but not a functional error.

**4. Program tests (Score: 5/5)**

*   **Strengths:** The code includes a comprehensive set of test cases using `assert` statements. These tests cover various inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and positive integers. The `assert` messages are informative and help identify the cause of failures. Also, tests check the correct exception is raised.
*   **Areas for improvement:** None.

**Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The tests are well-written and comprehensive.

**5. Measuring execution time (Score: 5/5)**

*   **Strengths:** The code accurately measures the execution time of both Fibonacci functions using the `time.time()` function. The `measure_execution_time` function is well-designed and reusable.
*   **Areas for improvement:** None.

**Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The execution time measurement is correctly implemented.

**6. Following good programming practice (Score: 5/5)**

*   **Strengths:** The code is well-documented with docstrings explaining the purpose, arguments, and return values of each function. The variable names are meaningful and follow naming conventions. Type annotations are used.
*   **Areas for improvement:** None.

**Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The code adheres to good programming practices.

## Summary

The submitted code demonstrates a strong understanding of basic control structures, function calls, variable handling, and program testing. The code is also well-documented and follows good programming practices. The student has successfully completed all the exercises in the assignment.
