### Evaluation of Programming Assignment

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**
   - **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - Feedback: The iterative function for computing the Fibonacci number is correctly implemented and handles edge cases such as inputs of 0 and 1. It produces accurate Fibonacci values, demonstrating a solid understanding of iterative logic.
   - **Verification:** The score is accurate. The feedback reflects the student's successful implementation and handling of edge cases effectively.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**
   - **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**
   - Feedback: The recursive function correctly computes Fibonacci values. However, it lacks efficiency for larger inputs due to exponential time complexity. To improve, consider implementing memoization to optimize the recursive calls. This will enhance performance significantly, especially for larger Fibonacci numbers.
   - **Verification:** The score is appropriate. The feedback rightly outlines the correctness of the implementation while noting the efficiency issues due to the recursion depth.

3. **Execution Time Measurement**
   - **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - Feedback: The time measurement implementation is clear and correctly measures execution time for the iterative Fibonacci function. However, it would be beneficial to implement time measurement for the recursive function as well, even if itâ€™s expected to be inefficient. This would demonstrate an understanding of comparative performance analysis.
   - **Verification:** The score is justified. The feedback accurately appreciates the clarity of the implementation while suggesting a practical improvement.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**
   - **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**
   - Feedback: A good number of test cases are provided, adequately covering basic scenarios. However, it would enhance the robustness of the testing by including more edge cases, such as negative numbers and larger Fibonacci numbers (beyond 10) for the recursive function. Testing known Fibonacci values (e.g., using a list of Fibonacci numbers) could help validate the correctness of your implementation better.
   - **Verification:** The score is consistent with the work presented. The feedback correctly identifies the need for additional edge cases to strengthen the robustness of the tests.

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**
   - **Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**
   - Feedback: While the code is functional, it lacks sufficient documentation and type annotations. Adding docstrings to functions that explain their purpose, parameters, and return types would improve understanding. Explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types can also enhance clarity and maintainability, adhering to best coding practices.
   - **Verification:** The score is justified. The feedback indicates the lack of necessary documentation and type annotations and highlights an area for improvement well.

### Summary
Overall, the submission demonstrates a strong understanding of iterative functions and basic control structures. To elevate it further, focus on optimizing the recursive function, enhancing test coverage, and improving documentation and annotations. Keep up the good work!
