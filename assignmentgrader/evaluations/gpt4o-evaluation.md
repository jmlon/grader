# Evaluation of Assignment Submission

## Learning Outcome Assessments

1. **Use of Control Structures**: **Score: 4/4**
   - The submission demonstrates correct use of conditionals (if-elif) and loops (for loop) in both the iterative and recursive Fibonacci functions. 
   - **Feedback**: Excellent usage of control structures to correctly handle edge cases (n less than or equal to 0 and n equal to 1).
   - **Verification**: The grade and feedback for this outcome are accurate. Full marks are deserved due to the correct implementation of control structures.

2. **Use of Function Calls**: **Score: 4/4**
   - Function calls are used appropriately, with parameters and return values handled correctly in both the iterative and recursive implementations.
   - **Feedback**: Great job implementing function calls effectively; the logic flows well between functions.
   - **Verification**: The grade and feedback for this outcome are accurate. The student successfully demonstrated proper handling of function calls.

3. **Handling of Variables**: **Score: 4/4**
   - Local variables are utilized correctly within the context of functions, and there is no unnecessary use of global variables.
   - **Feedback**: The management of variable scope is solid, ensuring clarity and maintaining good practice.
   - **Verification**: The grade and feedback for this outcome are accurate. There are no concerns in variable handling.

4. **Program Tests**: **Score: 4/4**
   - The submission contains comprehensive assert statements that correctly verify the expected results for both Fibonacci functions.
   - **Feedback**: Well done on implementing tests that ensure both functions perform as intended.
   - **Verification**: The grade and feedback for this outcome are accurate. The assert statements effectively verify functionality with appropriate coverage.

5. **Measuring Execution Time**: **Score: 3/4**
   - Execution time is measured and printed correctly for the iterative approach. However, the recursive function's execution time for n=50 was not measured due to a valid and practical concern about performance.
   - **Feedback**: Although it was sensible to avoid measuring the execution time of the recursive function due to performance issues, providing a note on how to handle larger inputs could improve this aspect.
   - **Verification**: The grade and feedback for this outcome need to be revised. While the student's decision to refrain from timing the recursive function for n=50 was prudent, the omission of a potential optimization discussion or alternative handling strategy (like memoization) indicates a slight shortfall from full marks. Therefore, a score of 3/4 is appropriate, with the feedback indicating a potential area for growth.

6. **Following Good Programming Practices**: **Score: 4/4**
   - The code is well documented, with meaningful variable names and clear overall structure.
   - **Feedback**: Good adherence to coding conventions. The documentation enhances understanding for anyone reviewing the code, which is commendable.
   - **Verification**: The grade and feedback for this outcome are accurate. The student effectively followed good programming practices.

## Summary of Feedback

- Overall, this assignment submission is strong, fulfilling the majority of the learning outcomes as outlined in the rubric. 
- To further improve, consider discussing strategies to optimize or handle larger Fibonacci numbers in recursive approaches in the comments or documentation, as well as explaining any potential drawbacks or solutions (e.g., memoization).
- Continue to maintain this level of clarity and thoughtful coding in future assignments, as it greatly benefits both your own learning and those who may read your code.
