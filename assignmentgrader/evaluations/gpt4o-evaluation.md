## Evaluation of Programming Assignment

Here's an evaluation of the submitted code based on the learning outcomes:

**1. Use of control structures**

*   **Score:** 5/5
*   **Feedback:** The iterative Fibonacci function correctly implements a `for` loop to calculate the Fibonacci number. The recursive function implicitly uses conditional control flow via the `if/elif` statements for the base cases.
*   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The iterative and recursive functions both demonstrate appropriate use of control structures.

**2. Use of function calls**

*   **Score:** 5/5
*   **Feedback:** The code demonstrates proper use of function calls, parameter passing (`n` in Fibonacci functions, `func` and `*args` in `measure_time`), and return values.
*   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The functions are well-defined and used correctly with parameters and return values.

**3. Handling of variables**

*   **Score:** 4/5
*   **Feedback:** The code primarily uses local variables, which is good. However, the code lacks type annotations, which reduces readability. Also, there is no docstring documentation for the functions.
*   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The use of local variables is good, and the points about missing type annotations and docstrings are valid.

**4. Program tests**

*   **Score:** 4/5
*   **Feedback:** The code includes `assert` statements to test the Fibonacci functions. The tests cover basic cases (0, 1, 10). However, more test cases with diverse inputs would improve the robustness of the tests.
*   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The tests are basic but functional, and the suggestion to add more diverse test cases is appropriate.

**5. Measuring execution time**

*   **Score:** 5/5
*   **Feedback:** The `measure_time` function accurately measures the execution time of a given function. The main program correctly calls this function and prints the execution time. It also acknowledges the impracticality of measuring the recursive Fibonacci for large n.
*   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The `measure_time` function works as expected and is used correctly.

**6. Following good programming practice**

*   **Score:** 3/5
*   **Feedback:**
    *   The code uses meaningful variable names.
    *   The structure is generally good, with functions for each task.
    *   The code lacks comprehensive documentation (docstrings) explaining the purpose, arguments, and return values of each function.
    *   Type annotations are missing. Adding type hints would significantly improve readability and maintainability.
*   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The points about missing docstrings and type annotations are important for good programming practice.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1.  **Add Docstrings:** Include docstrings at the beginning of each function to explain its purpose, arguments, and return value.
2.  **Use Type Annotations:** Add type annotations for function arguments and return values to improve code clarity and help catch type-related errors early on.
3.  **Expand Test Cases:** Add more test cases to cover a wider range of inputs, including edge cases and negative numbers (if applicable).
4.  **Consider `functools.wraps`:** When using `measure_time` as a decorator (though not explicitly requested), consider using `@functools.wraps(func)` to preserve the original function's metadata (name, docstring, etc.).
