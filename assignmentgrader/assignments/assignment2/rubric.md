| Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list                     | No implementation provided or completely incorrect implementation.                 | Basic implementation with significant errors or missing key operations.          | Correct implementation of the ADT Set with all required operations functional.   | Implementation is correct and includes additional features or optimizations.     | Implementation is exemplary, demonstrating advanced understanding and creativity. |
| Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements              | No encapsulation or validation implemented.                                        | Minimal encapsulation with ineffective validation of uniqueness.                 | Adequate encapsulation with a working validation method for uniqueness.          | Strong encapsulation with thorough validation ensuring no duplicates.             | Exemplary encapsulation and validation, demonstrating a deep understanding of ADTs. |
| Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)                 | No overrides implemented or incorrect implementations.                             | Basic overrides with significant errors or missing methods.                      | Correct implementation of equals, toString, and hashCode methods.               | Implementation is correct and includes additional considerations for equality.    | Implementation is exemplary, demonstrating advanced understanding of object equality. |
| Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations                               | No unit tests provided or tests are completely ineffective.                        | Minimal unit tests that do not adequately cover all operations.                 | Adequate unit tests covering all required operations with some validation.       | Comprehensive unit tests that thoroughly validate all operations and edge cases. | Exemplary unit tests that demonstrate a deep understanding of testing principles and edge cases. |
