### Learning Outcomes Evaluation

1. **Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** The implementation of the ADT Set is correct, and it includes all the required operations such as Union, Intersección, Diferencia, and DiferenciaSimetrica. The logic is clear, and the usage of the singly linked list is appropriate given the requirements. To improve further, consider adding more helper methods or optimizations, such as a method to clear the set or return its size.  
   **Verification:** The grade and feedback accurately reflect the student's work. The implementation is functional and adheres to the requirements.

2. **Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** The class encapsulates its data well, with a private Node class and a separate method for validation, ensuring that no duplicates can be added to the set. The `Validar` method is correctly structured to identify duplicates. For further improvement, include invoking the `Validar` method either in the constructor after adding elements or in the `Add` method to ensure the integrity of the set whenever elements are added.  
   **Verification:** The grade and feedback are appropriate as the encapsulation and validation of duplicates are adequately addressed.

3. **Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)**  
   **Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
   **Feedback:** The overrides for equals, GetHashCode, and ToString are implemented appropriately and effectively. The equals method robustly checks for the uniqueness of sets, and ToString provides a clear string representation of the elements. The inclusion of hash code generation adds to the overall implementation quality. Continue ensuring that future methods consider performance implications if the data set grows significantly.  
   **Verification:** The score and feedback are justified as the implementations exceed expectations and demonstrate advanced understanding.

4. **Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** The `Main` method serves as an effective unit test by validating all key operations. It checks the functionality of Union, Intersección, Diferencia, and DiferenciaSimetrica, along with equality checks. To enhance testing, consider implementing a dedicated testing framework or additional tests that cover edge cases, such as testing with empty sets or sets with only one element.  
   **Verification:** The feedback and score are accurate as the testing is effective but could be improved with edge case considerations.

### Summary  
Overall, the submission demonstrates a solid understanding of abstract data types and their implementations. There are minor areas for potential improvement, particularly regarding validation and testing comprehensiveness. Keep up the good work, and continue to explore more complex functionalities in your implementation!
