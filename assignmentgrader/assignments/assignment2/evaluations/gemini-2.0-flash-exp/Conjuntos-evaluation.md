|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list                     | 2     | The implementation does not utilize a singly linked list as required but instead uses generic arrays and a Bag structure from an external library, which violates the assignment's constraints. The essential operations such as union and intersection are implemented but not encapsulated within a class designed as a set. It would improve by strictly adhering to using a singly linked list and embedding the operations within the correct class structure. | Accurate - The feedback accurately identifies the use of arrays and the external Bag library, which directly contradicts the assignment requirements. The score of 2 reflects the significant issues present in the implementation. |
| Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements              | 1     | There are no measures for encapsulation, nor a validation method to ensure the uniqueness of elements in the set. A private validation function checking for duplicates should be included within a suitable ADT structure. To improve, implement object-oriented principles effectively with private data members and necessary accessors and mutators.                                           | Accurate - The feedback is correct in stating there is no encapsulation or validation for uniqueness. The score of 1 is justified as the student's implementation fails to meet basic requirements for encapsulation. |
| Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)                 | 3     | The implementation of `equals`, `toString`, and `hashCode` methods is provided; however, the `equals` method contains incorrect logic (e.g., misuse of `instanceof`), and `toString` has syntax issues, as it assumes the use of an array directly. These should be appropriately referenced to properties of the ADT. Improving by fixing these logical errors and observing the behavior as per Java conventions is essential.                | Needs Improvement - The feedback correctly addresses issues with the implementations of the methods. However, given that the methods are present, while flawed, the score of 3 may warrant reconsideration, potentially adjusting it to a 2. |
| Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations                               | 2     | The `main` method provides a limited number of tests for some operations, but it lacks comprehensive unit tests covering all required operations including difference and symmetric difference, as well as assertions to verify correctness. Expand by integrating JUnit or a similar framework and thoroughly testing all set operations with various cases to ensure reliability and correctness.                                            | Accurate - The feedback highlights the limited nature of the unit tests presented, justifying the score of 2 due to incomplete coverage of required functionality and a lack of assertions to validate outputs. |

### Overall Feedback
Overall, there are multiple areas for improvement. To align with the assignment requirements, focus on using a singly linked list for implementing the ADT, encapsulate the data correctly, validate uniqueness of elements, and enhance your unit testing to cover all functionality robustly. Consider reviewing Javaâ€™s conventions on handling generics and arrays more effectively.
