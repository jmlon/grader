1. **Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list**  
   **Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
   Verification: The grade is accurate. The implementation is exemplary, covering all required operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference correctly. The uniqueness of elements is ensured through checks prior to adding, demonstrating an efficient structure.

2. **Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   Verification: The grade is appropriate but could be improved. The encapsulation of the Node class and the head pointer is well done. While there is an effective duplicate check, the feedback indicates that validation should be enforced whenever items are added or modified to ensure the set remains valid. Therefore, this score should remain.

3. **Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)**  
   **Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
   Verification: The grade is correct. The implementations of Equals, ToString, and GetHashCode are executed exceptionally well, showcasing advanced knowledge of object equality and string representation, and also handling edge cases appropriately.

4. **Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   Verification: This score is justified. The unit tests in the main method cover all essential operations adequately. However, the feedback notes that additional edge cases could be included to strengthen the testing further, which maintains the score at 4 as it highlights room for improvement.

### General Feedback
The overall assessment rightly identifies the strengths of the implementation while providing constructive suggestions for future improvements. Enhancing the uniqueness validation in all modifying operations and expanding the unit tests to cover edge cases would be beneficial. Keep up the excellent work!
