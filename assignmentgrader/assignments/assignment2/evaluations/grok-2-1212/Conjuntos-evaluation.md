### Evaluation of Assignment Submission

#### Learning Outcome 1: Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list
- **Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**
  - **Feedback:** The implementation provided does not follow the requirement to use a singly linked list for the ADT Set. Instead, array-based methods are used with Java generics. Moreover, the key operations such as union, intersection, and difference are implemented as static methods rather than as instance methods of a Set class.
  - **Verification:** The score is accurate as the student did not adhere to the requirement of using a singly linked list, nor did they create an instance-based implementation for the operations.

#### Learning Outcome 2: Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements
- **Score: 1 (Unsatisfactory)**
  - **Feedback:** There is no implementation of encapsulation in the provided code. The uniqueness of elements is not validated upon adding items to the Set, making it possible to introduce duplicates. Additionally, the validations mentioned in the requirements (e.g., using a private method to validate uniqueness) are absent.
  - **Verification:** The score is accurate; the absence of encapsulation and uniqueness validation makes the submission unsatisfactory.

#### Learning Outcome 3: Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)
- **Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**
  - **Feedback:** The overrides for the `equals` and `toString` methods are incorrect and do not adhere to their intended functionality. The `equals` method attempts to check if `a` is an instance of `Conjuntos` incorrectly. The `toString` method references a variable `Conjuntos`, which does not exist, leading to a compilation issue. The `hashCode` method is reliant on `toString`, which is not structured properly.
  - **Verification:** The score is appropriate since the implementations of the methods do not conform to desired standards, indicating a need for improvement.

#### Learning Outcome 4: Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations
- **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**
  - **Feedback:** The `main` method performs basic tests for intersection, difference, and union operations, but does not cover all required functionality like difference symmetric and equals. Additionally, there is no testing to validate the uniqueness of elements after operations.
  - **Verification:** The score is partially accurate; while the basic tests meet expectations, they lack coverage of all required operations, thus justifying the score of 3.

### Summary of Scores
- Outcome 1: 2 (Needs Improvement)
- Outcome 2: 1 (Unsatisfactory)
- Outcome 3: 2 (Needs Improvement)
- Outcome 4: 3 (Meets Expectations)

### General Recommendations
To enhance your submission, focus on implementing the ADT Set correctly using a singly linked list. Ensure adherence to encapsulation principles and validate the uniqueness of elements. Additionally, refine the object method overrides, and strengthen your unit tests to cover all requirements comprehensively.
