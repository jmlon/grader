| Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list                     | 5     | The implementation of the ADT Set using a singly linked list is exemplary. All required operations, such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, are correctly implemented and functional. The use of encapsulation and private methods is appropriate.                    | Accurate      |
| Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements              | 4     | Strong encapsulation is present, and the validation method `Validar` correctly checks for duplicates. However, it could have been explicitly invoked whenever elements are added to ensure that the state of the set is always validated, rather than only being checked potentially after the fact. | Needs Change  |
| Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)                 | 5     | The overrides for `Equals`, `ToString`, and `GetHashCode` are implemented correctly and thoughtfully. The `GetHashCode` method reflects a good understanding of hash codes, and `Equals` properly checks for element equality. These implementations demonstrate advanced understanding of object equality.    | Accurate      |
| Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations                               | 5     | Unit testing is well-covered in the main method, testing all operations thoroughly and effectively. It validates that each operation behaves as expected and checks for equality correctly. The tests also display the results, enabling easy verification of outcomes.                          | Accurate      |

### Overall Feedback
The submission exhibits a strong and comprehensive understanding of the ADT Set and its operations using a singly linked list. The encapsulation and integrity of the data structure are well-managed. However, a minor suggestion for improvement would be to ensure that the validation method for checking uniqueness is triggered during the add operation to prevent any inconsistencies that may arise from external calls. Overall, an excellent submission that meets and exceeds expectations in most areas.
