### Evaluation of the Assignment on ADT Sets

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list 
**Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**  
**Feedback:**  
The implementation presented does not align with the requirement to use a singly linked list for storing the elements in the set. Instead, it leverages an array and attempts to perform set operations using array manipulation. While you have implemented key operations, the fundamental structure of a linked list is missing. To improve, consider implementing the `Conjunto` class using a singly linked list, ensuring that the unique elements are stored in the correct data structure as specified in the assignment.  
**Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The absence of a singly linked list implementation warrants a grade of 2 for this outcome.

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements
**Score: 1 (Unsatisfactory)**  
**Feedback:**  
There is no encapsulation of the ADT nor a validation method implemented to check for duplicate elements. To meet expectations, encapsulate your data by using private fields for storing the elements and implement a private method to validate uniqueness before adding elements to the set. This solution would enhance the integrity of your data structure.  
**Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The lack of encapsulation and validation for uniqueness justifies an Unsatisfactory rating.

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)
**Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
**Feedback:**  
You have provided implementations for the `equals`, `toString`, and `hashCode` methods. However, the `equals` method contains an error in the type checking, where it should use `instanceof` appropriately and cast the object correctly. Additionally, the `toString` method seems to reference a non-existent structure. For improvement, ensure proper object type checking, and correctly format the string representation of the instance variables of your ADT.  
**Verification:** The score is somewhat generous given the errors present in the `equals` and `toString` methods. A stricter evaluation may consider a lower score, but since the methods are mostly present, a 3 is acceptable with noted improvements needed.

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations
**Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**  
**Feedback:**  
Your implementation includes some basic tests in the `main` method, but does not fully cover all specified operations, such as testing for differences, and symmetric differences, as well as validating that the results do not contain duplicates. You should incorporate comprehensive unit tests for all required operations as outlined in the assignment, including edge cases, and ensure that all assertions confirm the correctness of the operations.  
**Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The lack of comprehensive unit tests for all specified operations justifies the needs improvement grade.

### Summary of Recommendations:
1. Refactor the implementation to utilize a singly linked list for the internal structure of the set.
2. Incorporate encapsulation of the set's properties and implement a method to validate the uniqueness of elements.
3. Correctly implement the `equals` and `toString` methods to rely on the right structure and logic.
4. Enhance the testing in your `main` method to fully validate all operations, checking for edge cases, and ensuring correctness.

This feedback aims to guide you towards meeting the learning outcomes as defined in the rubric. Good luck with your revisions!
