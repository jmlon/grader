### Evaluation of Assignment Submission

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list
**Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
**Feedback:** The implementation of the ADT Set utilizing a singly linked list is exemplary. All required operations such as `Union`, `Intersección`, `Diferencia`, and `DiferenciaSimetrica` are correctly and efficiently implemented. The use of helper methods such as `Contains` contributes to clarity and organization of the code.  
**Verification:** The grade and feedback for this outcome are accurate, reflecting the high quality of the implementation provided.

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements
**Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
**Feedback:** The encapsulation is strong, with private variables effectively hidden from outside access. The validation method `Validar` correctly checks for duplicates before adding elements, but it could be integrated into the `Add` method itself to ensure that operations are not allowed to proceed on sets with duplicates more transparently and efficiently. Adding this validation process directly will streamline the code and enhance readability.  
**Verification:** The grade is appropriate, but the feedback could highlight that the `Validar` method is a good initial step towards ensuring uniqueness, even if it could be better integrated into the `Add` method.

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)
**Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
**Feedback:** The overrides for `equals`, `GetHashCode`, and `ToString` are implemented correctly and demonstrate an advanced understanding of object equality and representation. The `ToString` method provides a clear textual representation of the set which is highly useful for debugging and presentation purposes.  
**Verification:** The feedback accurately reflects the student's understanding as demonstrated through their implementation of object methods.

#### Learning Outcome: Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations
**Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
**Feedback:** The `Main` method includes adequate unit tests for the various operations, such as `Union`, `Intersección`, `Diferencia`, and `DiferenciaSimetrica`, clearly demonstrating functionality. However, while the tests effectively show basic use cases, incorporating additional edge cases (e.g., testing with empty sets, sets with one element, or sets with many duplicates) would significantly enhance the robustness and thoroughness of the testing process.  
**Verification:** The grade is justified as the unit tests cover essential functionality but do lack depth. The feedback could stress the importance of edge-case testing more.

### Overall Summary
Overall, your performance on this assignment is commendable, showcasing a deep understanding of abstract data types and linked list implementations. Future improvements could be made by refining encapsulation practices, integrating validation more seamlessly within methods, and broadening unit test scenarios. Keep up the great work!
