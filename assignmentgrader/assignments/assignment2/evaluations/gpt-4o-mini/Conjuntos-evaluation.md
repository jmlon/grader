### Evaluation of Assignment: ADT Set Implementation

#### Learning Outcome 1: Ability to implement the ADT Set using a singly linked list  
**Score: 1 (Unsatisfactory)**  
**Feedback:** The implementation provided does not use a singly linked list to represent the set as required. Instead, it utilizes arrays and a predefined `Bag` class. This fails to meet the criteria for the ADT implementation. To improve, ensure that a singly linked list is properly implemented to hold the elements of the set, and include all necessary operations as described in the API.  
**Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate.

#### Learning Outcome 2: Ability to ensure encapsulation and validate uniqueness of elements  
**Score: 1 (Unsatisfactory)**  
**Feedback:** There is no encapsulation in the design to protect the data structure, nor is there any validation to ensure that unique elements are maintained. To improve upon this aspect, consider implementing private variables within the class that hold the elements, along with a private validation method that checks for duplicates before adding any new element.  
**Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate.

#### Learning Outcome 3: Ability to override Object methods (equals, toString, hashCode)  
**Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
**Feedback:** The methods `equals`, `toString`, and `hashCode` have been implemented, but they lack correctness. The `equals` method has an incorrect type check and uses `Arrays.equals` on the main class, which isn't appropriate. Additionally, the `toString` method references an undeclared variable `Conjuntos`, which should refer to the actual set elements. Focus on ensuring these methods adhere to proper semantics of the Java Object class and correctly implement comparisons.  
**Verification:** The score needs to be changed to 2 (Needs Improvement) due to the incorrect implementations.

#### Learning Outcome 4: Ability to conduct unit testing for set operations  
**Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**  
**Feedback:** While there are basic tests for some operations like intersection and difference, the testing methodology is inadequate. There are no tests for union, symmetric difference, or equality checks, nor do you validate that there are no duplicates in the resulting sets. To enhance testing, create robust unit tests that not only invoke each operation but also include assertions to verify correctness and check for duplicate elements.  
**Verification:** The score is appropriate, but there may be room to raise it slightly to a 3 (Meets Expectations) if the tests performed on intersection and difference are considered to partially meet the requirement.

### Overall Summary:  
The assignment requires a significant overhaul to meet the expectations outlined in the rubric. Ensuring the correct use of a singly linked list, implementing encapsulation properly, and thoroughly enhancing the unit tests are key areas for improvement. Focus on adhering to the assignment requirements more closely and leverage the provided rubric to guide revisions for future submissions.
