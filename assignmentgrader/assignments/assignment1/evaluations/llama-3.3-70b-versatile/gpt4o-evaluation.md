### Evaluation of Assignment Submission

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**: **4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - **Verification**: The provided feedback accurately reflects the implementation quality. The function effectively handles edge cases and produces correct values. Although it is suggested to consider optimizations for larger values, the current implementation is sufficient for the scope of the assignment. No change needed.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**: **3 (Meets Expectations)**
   - **Verification**: The feedback correctly identifies that the function computes the Fibonacci numbers correctly but highlights the inefficiency related to the exponential time complexity. The suggestion of using memoization for optimization is appropriate and constructive. No change needed.

3. **Execution Time Measurement**: **4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - **Verification**: The feedback accurately assesses the implementation of the timing function, noting its effectiveness in measuring execution time for the iterative function. The suggestion to benchmark smaller values for the recursive function is also relevant, given its impracticality at `n = 50`. No change needed.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**: **3 (Meets Expectations)**
   - **Verification**: The feedback recognizes that the tests cover basic scenarios, which is correct. However, it appropriately suggests increasing test coverage to include edge cases. This feedback is sound and aligns with best practices in software testing. No change needed.

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**: **2 (Needs Improvement)**
   - **Verification**: The feedback accurately notes the lack of documentation and type annotations in the code, which are essential for clarity in programming. The suggestion to include docstrings and type annotations is essential for improving the code quality and adhering to best practices. No change needed.

### Summary of Suggestions for Improvement:
Overall, this submission demonstrates strong functionality and adherence to good programming practices. To maximize scoring potential, the student should consider the following improvements: enhance the recursive function with memoization, expand test coverage to include edge cases, and improve documentation to clarify function purposes and align with Python conventions.
