# Evaluation of Programming Assignment Submission

## Learning Outcomes and Scores

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Verification:** The feedback accurately reflects the implementation as the iterative function is correct and handles edge cases well. The suggestion for improvements, such as including specific optimizations, aligns with enhancing clarity and understanding of performance.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
   **Verification:** This score is appropriate since the recursive implementation does correctly calculate Fibonacci values, but the absence of memoization is noted as a shortcoming. Additionally, the feedback is accurate in stating that stack overflow risks could occur for larger Fibonacci indices, which is a valid concern for recursive functions.

3. **Execution Time Measurement**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Verification:** The assessment correctly states that the timing function is well-implemented and provides a clear output of results and execution times. The suggestion for further timing analyses to provide deeper insights is valid, promoting an even more robust performance analysis.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Verification:** This score is justified as the submission includes a good set of test cases, effectively covering both normal and edge cases with assertions. The feedback mentions the opportunity for adding additional comments regarding test case selection, which could indeed enhance understanding but does not detract from the overall quality of testing.

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**  
   **Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
   **Verification:** The score accurately represents the documentation quality, which is thorough and well-annotated. The documentation adheres to best practices and significantly enhances code readability and maintainability, making this section exemplary.

## Overall Feedback

Your submission demonstrates a strong understanding of both iterative and recursive programming concepts. The code is structured well, making good use of classes and methods, which promotes modularity. The test cases validate functionality effectively.

However, consider the following areas for improvement:
- **Memoization in Recursive Function**: Optimizing your recursive Fibonacci implementation could prevent performance issues with larger inputs and align it closer to optimal implementations.
- **Additional Timing Analyses**: Expanding the scope of your timing analyses would provide deeper insights.
- **Comments on Test Cases**: Providing rationale behind the chosen test cases could enhance clarity for reviewers. 

Keep up the excellent work! Your attention to documentation and structured code is commendable!
