### Evaluation of Programming Assignment

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   Feedback: The iterative implementation of the Fibonacci function is correct and handles edge cases well. It efficiently calculates Fibonacci numbers for non-negative integers. To reach the optimal level, consider adding some comments to explain your approach and logic used in the implementation.  
   **Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The student has implemented the iterative function correctly and it works well with edge cases.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
   Feedback: The recursive function accurately computes Fibonacci numbers but does not handle edge cases optimally. While it is correct for small values, it becomes inefficient for larger numbers and could benefit from memoization to reduce exponential time complexity. Improving the function by implementing memoization would enhance performance and push the score higher.  
   **Verification:** The grade is appropriate, but the feedback could be more specific. Although it meets basic expectations, there should be a clearer emphasis on the performance issue of recursion, especially for larger inputs like 50.

3. **Execution Time Measurement**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   Feedback: You successfully implemented a timing function that measures the execution time of other functions clearly and effectively. The timing output format is also clear. To elevate your work to the highest level, consider incorporating more comprehensive timing analysis, such as average time over multiple runs.  
   **Verification:** The grade and feedback are accurate. The timing function is implemented correctly and provides clear output.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**  
   **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
   Feedback: There are a sufficient number of test cases covering basic scenarios for both functions, effectively validating their correctness. However, not attempting to test the recursive function for the 50th Fibonacci number does show a lack of thoroughness in edge case testing. More diverse tests, particularly checking potential edge cases like negative inputs and larger values, would improve this aspect.  
   **Verification:** The grade is correct, but the feedback could further highlight the importance of exploring edge cases more thoroughly in testing, particularly for recursive approaches.

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**  
   **Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**  
   Feedback: There is minimal documentation and no type annotations present in the code. While the logic is relatively comprehensible, providing comments that clarify the purpose and functionality of each function would enhance readability. Implementing type annotations would also make the function signatures clearer regarding expected input and output types, thus adhering to good programming practices.  
   **Verification:** The feedback is accurate and reflects the need for improvement in documentation and type annotations. The current lack reduces the code's readability and maintainability.

### Summary
Overall, this submission demonstrates a competent understanding of basic programming constructs, particularly in relation to function implementation and time measurement. Attention to documentation and testing of edge cases can significantly improve the quality of your work. Keep up the solid work while focusing on the suggested areas for improvement!
