### Evaluation of Programming Assignment

**1. Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**  
**Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
Feedback: The iterative function for computing the Fibonacci number is correctly implemented and handles edge cases well (e.g., n = 0 and n = 1). To improve this, consider optimizations such as tail recursion or discussing the space complexity for larger n, though it is currently effective.  
**Verification**: The score and feedback are accurate as the implementation is correct, and it does handle edge cases appropriately.

---

**2. Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**  
**Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
Feedback: The recursive function works correctly for small values of n, returning accurate Fibonacci numbers. However, it does not efficiently handle larger values of n due to exponential time complexity. To exceed expectations, consider implementing memoization or providing an explanation of why this method is inefficient for higher n.  
**Verification**: This score is appropriate given that while the function works correctly for smaller inputs, it does not optimize for larger inputs, which is a notable drawback.

---

**3. Execution Time Measurement**  
**Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
Feedback: The time measurement function is effectively implemented, clearly calculating and printing execution time. However, to score an excellent rating, you could further analyze the results beyond just reporting the execution time, perhaps by including comparisons of time vs. Fibonacci number.  
**Verification**: The feedback correctly identifies that the function is well implemented but suggests room for deeper analysis, making the score appropriate.

**4. Testing and Validation of Functions**  
**Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
Feedback: The tests cover basic cases successfully, such as Fibonacci of 0, 1, and 10, which provides confidence in the functions' correctness. To improve, incorporate more edge cases such as negative inputs or higher Fibonacci numbers and include descriptions for each test case.  
**Verification**: The score reflects the effectiveness of the tests although the feedback accurately points out that further edge cases could be included to enhance testing rigor.

---

**5. Code Documentation and Type Annotations**  
**Score: 2 (Needs Improvement)**  
Feedback: While the code has a clear structure, there is minimal documentation or type annotations, which limits clarity. To improve, add docstrings for all functions that explain the parameters, return types, and the purpose of each function. This will enhance understandability and maintainability.  
**Verification**: The score and feedback are accurate, as sufficient documentation and annotations are indeed lacking, necessitating improvement for clarity and maintainability.

### Overall Suggestions for Improvement
- Enhance recursive function efficiency with memoization to handle larger inputs.
- Adopt more robust testing strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of edge cases and potential failure points.
- Include detailed documentation and type annotations for all functions to meet best practices in code readability.

These improvements will help raise your assignment to an excellent standard across all areas defined in the rubric.
