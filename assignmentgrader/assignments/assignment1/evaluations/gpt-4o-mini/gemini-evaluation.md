### Evaluation of the Assignment

#### Learning Outcomes and Scores

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** The iterative Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and handles edge cases appropriately, including negative inputs and base cases. The use of a loop is efficient and the solution is optimal in terms of time complexity. Minor improvements could include adding more comments for clarity on the logic used.  
   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The function displays a good implementation of the iterative approach with minor room for improvement in comments.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**  
   **Score: 3 (Meets Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** The recursive Fibonacci function works correctly for valid inputs and returns expected values. However, it has a potential performance issue with larger inputs since it does not utilize memoization. Incorporating memoization would greatly enhance its efficiency for larger values of n.  
   **Verification:** The score and feedback are appropriate. The function correctly implements recursion, but the performance concerns are valid and note-worthy. 

3. **Execution Time Measurement**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** The execution time measurement function is clearly implemented and effectively measures the time taken by the Fibonacci functions. The function is versatile as it can accept any function with arguments. To exceed expectations, consider adding more details in the output regarding time measurement conditions.  
   **Verification:** The score and feedback are accurate. The function performs well and neatly captures execution timing, though minor detailing could enhance it further.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**  
   **Score: 4 (Exceeds Expectations)**  
   **Feedback:** A robust set of test cases is used to validate both functions, covering a range of inputs including edge cases. Using assertions to validate the results enhances reliability. Future submissions could benefit from expanding tests to include larger numbers or stressing edge cases that may affect performance.  
   **Verification:** The score and feedback are correct. The testing approach is comprehensive, but greater testing on larger inputs could further strengthen robustness. 

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**  
   **Score: 5 (Excellent)**  
   **Feedback:** The code is exceptionally documented with comprehensive docstrings that explain the purpose of each function and detail the arguments and return values. Type annotations are appropriately utilized, enhancing code readability and maintainability. This is an exemplary feature of the submission.  
   **Verification:** The score and feedback are both accurate. The documentation quality significantly contributes to understanding, showcasing best practices in programming.

### Overall Feedback
The submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts required for the assignment, with most components exceeding expectations. The clear structure, proper documentation, and testing strategies employed here validate the functionality well. To improve, consider refining the recursive function for efficiency and perhaps further documenting performance aspects of execution timings. Excellent job!
