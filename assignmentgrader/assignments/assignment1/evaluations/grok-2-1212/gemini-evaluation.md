## Evaluation of Programming Assignment Submission

### Learning Outcomes and Corresponding Scores

1. **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**: **4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - Feedback: The iterative Fibonacci function is implemented correctly and handles edge cases appropriately, returning Fibonacci values accurately for all tested inputs. Further optimizing the function to use constant space could achieve an excellent rating.
   - **Verification**: The grade is accurate as the function correctly implements the iterative approach and handles edge cases such as negative input without issues. However, implementation could be improved with optimal space usage, justifying the "Exceeds Expectations" grade.

2. **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**: **3 (Meets Expectations)**
   - Feedback: The recursive Fibonacci function returns the correct Fibonacci numbers. However, it could be improved by incorporating memoization to enhance efficiency, especially for larger inputs. This would help it avoid excessive recursive calls, which lead to significant computation time.
   - **Verification**: The grade is appropriate since the recursive implementation works correctly, but it does not utilize memoization, which would notably improve performance for larger inputs. Thus, the feedback correctly addresses the need for improvement.

3. **Execution Time Measurement**: **4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - Feedback: The execution time measurement function is well-implemented and clearly reports the execution time of both iterative and recursive methods. It would be beneficial to provide more context or analysis alongside the results to deepen the insight into the performance differences.
   - **Verification**: The assigned grade is accurate and well-justified in the feedback provided. The timing function measures execution effectively, though deepening the analysis would enhance the evaluation without changing the overall grade.

4. **Testing and Validation of Functions**: **4 (Exceeds Expectations)**
   - Feedback: A good suite of test cases is provided, including edge cases. However, the iterative function could have been tested for larger values (like 50 and above) to further ensure reliability and performance. Including edge cases would also bolster the testing phase further.
   - **Verification**: This score is correct. The testing strategy covers various cases, but including tests for more substantial numbers in the iterative function would have further strengthened the submission. The feedback accurately reflects this opportunity for enhancement.

5. **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**: **5 (Excellent)**
   - Feedback: The code is exceptionally well-documented, with clear docstrings for each function, including type annotations. This practice adheres to best programming standards and enhances readability and maintainability. No further improvements are necessary in this area.
   - **Verification**: The grade is well-deserved, as the documentation aligns excellently with best practices in programming. The clarity and detail of type annotations also support this rating.

### Summary of Improvements

- **Memoization for Recursive Function**: Consider enhancing the recursive Fibonacci function to use memoization strategies to improve performance.
- **Testing Edge Cases**: Incorporate tests for larger Fibonacci numbers in both functions to demonstrate performance at scale. This also includes handling possible timeout for the recursive method.
- **Analysis of Execution Timing**: Providing commentary on the performance differences between the iterative and recursive functions would deepen the analysis and make the timing results more informative.

Overall, this submission demonstrates a strong grasp of basic programming skills with clear adherence to good practices. Keep up the great work!
