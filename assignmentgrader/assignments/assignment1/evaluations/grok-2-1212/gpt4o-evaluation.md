| **Implementation of Iterative Fibonacci Function**                | 4     | The iterative Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and handles edge cases such as n=0 and n=1. Good job! It would be optimal to ensure its efficiency for larger inputs. | The score is appropriate as the function is correct and handles edge cases but could improve efficiency further. Feedback accurately reflects this. |
| **Implementation of Recursive Fibonacci Function**                 | 3     | The recursive function implements the Fibonacci sequence correctly. However, it does not handle larger inputs efficiently and lacks memoization, which could improve performance significantly.  | The score is justified; the function works correctly but suffers from performance issues which are noted in the feedback. |
| **Execution Time Measurement**                                     | 4     | The time measurement function is implemented correctly, and the results are clear. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed output about the timing analysis for better insight. | The score aligns with the implementation as the function is correct. The feedback suggests a way to improve, which is valid but does not detract from the overall quality. |
| **Testing and Validation of Functions**                            | 3     | Testing for basic cases is present and correct, but the tests could include edge cases such as negative numbers or larger Fibonacci numbers, which would strengthen the validation. | The score is deserved since basic cases are covered, but the absence of edge cases could be highlighted further. Feedback aligns with the score as it suggests improvement while acknowledging correct implementation. |
| **Code Documentation and Type Annotations**                       | 2     | While the code is generally readable, it lacks detailed documentation and type annotations. Including docstrings and type hints would enhance clarity and adherence to good programming practices. | The score is accurate; the feedback correctly identifies the shortcomings in documentation and annotations, which need improvement. |

Overall Feedback: Your assignment demonstrates a solid understanding of basic control structures and recursion in programming. There was a strong showing in the iterative Fibonacci implementation, and you have effectively measured execution time for functions. To enhance your programming skills, focus on optimizing the recursive approach and improving your testing and documentation practices for future assignments. The overall evaluation reflects the strengths and areas for improvement succinctly and accurately.
