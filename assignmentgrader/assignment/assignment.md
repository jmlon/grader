# Programming Assignment

The goal of this programming assignment is to verify basic control structures and recursive functions are properly handled.
A secondary goal is to verify the student follows good programming practices, such as following naming conventions, limiting the scope of variables.

Exercises to develop:

1. Write an iterative function to compute the n-th fibonacci number.
2. Write a recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number.
3. Write a function that measures the execution time of another function.
4. The main program should perform the following tasks:
    - Test a few cases for both functions. Use assert to verify the response is correct.
    - Measure the time of execution of both functions for the 50-th fibonacci number and print the time in seconds.
5. Document you code and use type annotations.
