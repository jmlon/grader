# Rubric for the assigment

## Learning outcomes

1. Use of control structures
The program handles control structures such as conditionals and loops correctly.

2. Use of function calls
The program makes function calls and handles parameters and return values correctly.

3. Handling of variables
The program handles local and global variables. Avoids the use of unnecesssary global variables.

4. Program tests
The tests are written using `assert` statements and verify that both functions return the correct result.

5. Measuring execution time
The program measures execution time for both functions and reports the time in seconds.

6. Following good programming practice
The program is well documented, names of variables are meaningful and follows good practices.
