TITLE: AI-Assisted Grading Crew


# Introduction

TODO:
1. What is the problem?
- Grading homeworks is a tedious task that requires human effort to grade. Human grading is prone to bias and errors due to fatigue.
2. Why solving it with an AI assistant?
- In many cases homeworks are essays or code, the kind of tasks for which language models excell at.
3. Benefits of using a Crew (vs single LLM model + prompt engineering)
- The CrewAI system provides easy means to divide the grading task into smaller chunks that can be done by AI agents. Different AI agents can be used for specific tasks, making it possible to use LLMs that perform better for the assigned task. The agentic system also makes it possible to use very specific prompts for each agent.

# Methodology

TODO:
1. Explain the architecture of the CrewAI agentic system.
- We defined two agents: One for doing the initial grading, and a second one to review the final grade.
- There are two tasks, the grading task and the reviewing task, assigned to the correponding agents.
- Agents take as inputs the assignment, the rubric for the assignment, and the student submission. This, combined with a very specific prompt provides very precise instructions for the LLM to do its work.
2. Describe the test cases
- For the evaluation of the system, we used two programming assigments, with their respective rubrics, an vaious combinations of LLMs to evaluate how LLMs performed at the different tasks.
3. Describe the evaluation metrics
- The results were evaluated by hand, by qualitatively reviewing the assigned grade and the review of the grade generated by the crew.
